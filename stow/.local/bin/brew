# Wrapper for `brew` that ensures PATH overrides are cleared.

# If system tools like coreutils are overridden in the current shell, homebrew
# will not have access to the expected versions, and could cause some actions to
# fail or have unexpected behavior.

# This tries to decontaminate the environment by restoring PATH to the default
# system state.
